# Services
services:
  overview: CivicMapper helps our customers better understand, address, and implement solutions through the use and development of geodata and geospatial technology. To that end, we offer several flexible ways to work with you 
  levels:
  - title: Map Shop
    subtitle: Need a map? No matter the content, format, use, or audience, our geospatial and subject-area expertise can you create targeted maps, mapping applications, and geospatial analysis tools.
    desc:
      - We provide general-purpose consulting for civic organizations, bringing our geospatial and subject-area expertise to your organization's individual projects. Our consulting services include 
      - <ul><li>geospatial data collection, curation, and maintenance</li><li>web mapping application development and deployment</li><li>spatial and non-spatial data visualization</li><li>strategic planning for geographic information systems (GIS) implementation</li></ul>
      - We emphasize creating mapping solutions and data that have a long life-cycle and are able to serve the organization and the public long after the project ends.

# Process
process:
  - title: 1. Discover
    subtitle: data visualization
    desc: Sometimes just seeing your data on a map provides a spark that changes how you think about your data. We use state-of-the-art 2D and 3D visualization and analysis tools to help you understand your data.
    fa-icon: fa-map
  - title: 2. Curate
    subtitle: data capture, integration, and maintenance
    desc: In today's "big data" world, wrapping your head around how to manage it all in a way that is best for your organization can be a challenge. We treat <a href="">data as a living product</a> and know how to design processes to manage data to support your mission, without distracting from it.
    fa-icon: fa-database
  - title: 3. Interact
    subtitle: web map/app development
    desc: Curated data, maps, and visualizations are the first steps; enabling interactivity and analysis are the next. Drawing on our expertise with the full geospatial technology stack, data to map to analysis, we develop and deploy the best-fit mapping technology that allows you (and your audience) to gain deep insights into your data.
