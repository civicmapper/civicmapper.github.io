# Process
process:
  - title: 1. Discover
    subtitle: data visualization
    desc: Sometimes just seeing your data on a map provides a spark that changes how you think about your data. We use state-of-the-art 2D and 3D visualization and analysis tools to help you understand your data.
    fa-icon: fa-map
  - title: 2. Curate
    subtitle: data capture, integration, and maintenance
    desc: In today's "big data" world, wrapping your head around how to manage it all in a way that is best for your organization can be a challenge. We treat <a href="">data as a living product</a> and know how to design processes to manage data to support your mission, without distracting from it.

  - title: 3. Interact
    subtitle: web map/app development
    desc: Curated data, maps, and visualizations are the first steps; enabling interactivity and analysis are the next. Drawing on our expertise with the full geospatial technology stack, data to map to analysis, we develop and deploy the best-fit mapping technology that allows you (and your audience) to gain deep insights into your data.
