<p><strong>Open by default.</strong> Our work is guided by open data principles and concepts. We work to make geodata accessible and transparent from project inception to implementation.</p>

<p><strong>Data as a living product.</strong> Data is not just a deliverable - it is an evolving element of your organization. We work with you to structure existing processes to support maintenance of data so that it grows and supports your mission.</p>

<p><strong>Platform integration.</strong> We use the platforms for geographic data collection, collaboration, and dissemination tools that are right for your needs now, with an eye towards future aspirations.</p>

<p><strong>Agile and iterative development.</strong> Whether the goal is to building a simple map or a complex geospatial database, new information gleaned from the development process can necessitate a change in approach or scope. We employ an agile and iterative spiral approach to development, testing early and breaking often, in order to optimize the solution early.</p>
