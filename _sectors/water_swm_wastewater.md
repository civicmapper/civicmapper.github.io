For Water, Sewer, or Stormwater authorities that need to combine datasets and synthesize different types of information, CivicMapper can help. We can provide GIS support for your planning, capital improvement, service expansion, or operating needs.

We provide:

* General GIS such as geospatial data creation and editing support to augment the specialized GIS expertise
* GIS for "linear assets" you might already have for infrastructure maintenance.
* Implementation support to set up a full scale GIS implementation across your enterprise.
* Web based GIS maps that let you interact with your data when you arenâ€™t at your desk.
