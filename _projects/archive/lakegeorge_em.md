As a remote sensing engineer and project manager at the Institute for the Application of Geospatial Technology, Emily used GIS data sets, field data and reference imagery to train an image processing program to create a semi-automated classification of more than 30 discrete land cover classes within the Lake George Watershed. The land cover classes were later used for change detection studies and for developing models for non-point source pollution.
