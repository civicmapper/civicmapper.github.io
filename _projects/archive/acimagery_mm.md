As the GIS Manager for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, Matt implemented the Countyâ€™s imagery and change detection data program. This entailed orchestrating the capture of high resolution nadir and oblique imagery for the entire county every 2 years, managing data change analysis, and building hydrographically corrected topography to support stormwater modeling.
