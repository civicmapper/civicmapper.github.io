Matt implemented enterprise Esri-based GIS services for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, to support Computer-Aided Mass Appraisal (CAMA) reassessment. This entailed creating a foundational and authoritative property database that could be accessed through spatial and non-spatial data portals and making data available externally and internally through built-to-purpose interactive web map viewers.
