To support the development of an Open Space Master Plan for the Town of Cochrane, Alberta, Christian helped O2 Planning + Design to develop a parks inventory analysis tool in ArcGIS based on the composite values level of service (CVLOS) methodology described by the American Planning Association. Taking into account condition and quality, variety and number of amenities, usage, and other factors captured in an inventory, the tool calculated a score for each park. It then produced a spatial and tabular summary of the recreation opportunities the Town's overall parks system was providing to residents in areas within walking distance. In effect, the tool illustrated the locations of park or amenity 'deserts'. This information was used in the master plan to make comprehensive recommendations for management and improvements at specific locations.
