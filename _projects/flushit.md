For ALCOSAN's 2017 Open House, we prepared an interactive demo for visitors to explore how far and where the wastewater from a specific address goes before getting to the ALCOSAN treatement facility. 

 After typing in an address, users would see the route their flush took, and what municipalities and Pittsburgh neighborhoods it traveled under. Total mileage and and estimate of the capacity of the pipes used was also provided. A representation of the complete sewer infrastructure network in the ALCOSAN service area was also shown on the map, sourced from 3 Rivers Wet Weather's Sewer Atlas. 

This fun little demo was a hit, as most visitors didn't realize just how far their flushes go.
