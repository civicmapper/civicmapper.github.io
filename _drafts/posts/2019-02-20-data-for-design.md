Geospatial information has always been core to the workflows of urban planning, landscape architecture, architecture, and engineering projects.

Traditionally, these kinds of projects begin with geodata collection: gathering drawings, field data collection, digitization of analog data, collecting available digital data, and creating maps. In the digital era, using spatial data typically (though, unfortunately not always) involves using GIS software to organize, manage, and derive data. Regardless of whether the project is the scale of a long-term city plan or the scale of a detailed design for a green stormwater infrastructure project, this first step creates an information foundation on which decisions are made.

Achieving an innovative and optimum design in these kinds of projects is an iterative process that involves feedback from stakeholders. Using geospatial data and mapping in mapping to support the design process undoubtedly makes the outreach and feedback processes more effective. The maps provide the medium for dicussions of quantitative and qualitative aspects of a project.

The major challenge with using spatial data in a design workflow is often identified in the technical logistics of the process. Out-of-the-box GIS software isn't directly configured to support an iterative design workflow or answer the kinds of questions these processes tend to need to answer&mdash;of course this makes sense when recognizing that  GIS software is designed for many users, audiences, and workflows. Consequently, using geodata and GIS-based analysis tools within the iterative, exploratory, creative nature of the design process has a tendency to be seen as slowing down internal and external feedback loops.

The idea of better supporting the design process with digital spatial data and geospatial analysis tools, though not a new idea, has in recent years been called [GeoDesign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesign) (mostly thanks to Esri, which uses the term liberally in its marketing materials). This buzzword has a number of evolving definitions, interpretations and critiques. Stephen Ervin, of the Harvard GSD, succinctly described GeoDesign has "a design and planning method which tightly couples the creation of design proposals with impact simulation informed by geographic contexts, systems thinking, and digital technologies" during the 2012 Esri GeoDesign Summit. The key sentiment is the tight coupling of technology and process, which suggests an evolution of the software to directly support iterative design workflows.

GIS software and computing capability has of course evolved since 2012, and will continue to evolve. The design professions will continue to rely on geodata. More and more software tools will be available that directly support the design process, which is to say that the methods of the process will become codified and packaged as their own tools and software, rather than built using other tools and software. The software challenges will be addressed.

That said, a critical, fundamental issue remains in these projects: the quality, pedigree, and management of the data at the foundation of the process. The evolution of the software tools is for naught if quality, portablity, and maintenance lifecycle of the underlying data remain unresolved. These things can pose serious challenges to organizations that want to take their design processes and outreach to the next level. For example:

* If data is of unknown quality and age, this brings uncertainty to the decision-making process;
* When it's assumed that all new data created must be of higher precision (e.g. survey-grade data), even when the decision-making doesn't require that level of detail, project costs and time requirements unnecessarily increase;
* When it's assumed that any missing data must be created from scratch, even though a "good-enough" source may already exist, project costs and time requirements increase;
* If data that is viewable and interactive during the project (e.g., through some app or proprietary software) is ultimately unable to be extracted (or is available only in a non-standard or proprietary format), then it's not probably going to be useful/used;
* If the data is being used to inform decision-making beyond the end of the project, and maintenance of the data has not been addressed, then it's not probably going to be useful/used.

CivicMapper is familiar with each of these challenges and has experience helping organizations address them in planning, design, and engineering projects.

Almost every group we’ve worked with has a version of the old or unknown quality of data concern. Sometimes they're getting a lot of information from many sources, making it hard to identify a trusted data source. Sometimes they pay a lot of money for static PDF reports with data that can’t be readily assessed or manipulated. Other times, they don’t have direct access to the data, and need the owner or third-party to interpret it for them in order to make decisions. The question that firms ask over and over again is how they can get the data that they’ve already paid for so they can work with it directly and ask questions of it.

At CivicMapper, we are developing core data products that decouple the data from the application and make both sides more flexible. 

Our approach is 

* using GIS in a web-first, desktop-last manner;
* thinking about data as services, not just deliverables;
* regarding data like software: it needs maintenance and updates, or else it becomes obsolete.

A key component of this is putting the completed design work into web-enabled mapping applications to make it more usable by the rest of the project team and other stakeholders.

Design firms sometimes make the mistake of thinking they need new survey data for a project, when what they really need is the best available data. We often see design firms saying "I need high quality data", rather than “I need survey data”. This data may already exist in some form, and CivicMapper helps firms utilize these data as well as get valuable feedback during the life of the project.
